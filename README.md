shaman super macros
So far I have put together 2 macros, one for 1hand/shield and one for 2hander
The program checks for and applies lightning shield, rockbiter/or/windfury weapon, casts stormstrike on cooldown, casts flame shock and checks for flame shock debuff, if active casts earth shock. When below 30% mana, shocks are downranked to rank 3.

Known bugs: Sometimes it applies rockbiter when I want to cast windury.

Updated rotation (flame shock>earth shock) based on the gear I have now for solo play. Added downranking to rank 4 at 60% mana and rank 1 at 20%. Assuming you will be dropping at least windfury totem, I changed buff to rockbiter. That was only difference before so they should work the same no matter the weapons, but can easily swap earth/flame/frost or rockbiter/windfury. If I'm feeling lazy I just put it to windfury and let it brrrr without dropping totems.

Known bugs: Downranking code is sloppy will have to redo.



shammy1button 1.2

It has come to my attention that on turtle wow, the weapon buffs do not stack. So if you intend to use windfury as I do, you can't use the other ones. I guess in groups it's best to not use a weapon buff at all if you want to take advantage of windfury totem. So, code changed to apply and keep up windfury weapon. Will add 2nd file with weapon buff removed to try in groups. Also fixed downranking coding.
