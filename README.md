shaman super macros
So far I have put together 2 macros, one for 1hand/shield and one for 2hander
The program checks for and applies lightning shield, rockbiter/or/windfury weapon, casts stormstrike on cooldown, casts flame shock and checks for flame shock debuff, if active casts earth shock. When below 30% mana, shocks are downranked to rank 3.

Known bugs: Sometimes it applies rockbiter when I want to cast windury.


shammy1button 1.1

Updated rotation (flame shock>earth shock) based on the gear I have now for solo play. Added downranking to rank 4 at 60% mana and rank 1 at 20%. Assuming you will be dropping at least windfury totem, I changed buff to rockbiter. That was only difference before so they should work the same no matter the weapons, but can easily swap earth/flame/frost or rockbiter/windfury. If I'm feeling lazy I just put it to windfury and let it brrrr without dropping totems.

Known bugs: Downranking code is sloppy will have to redo.




REQUIRED ADDONS:

Super Macros, Quick Weapon Swap
