shaman super macros
So far I have put together 2 macros, one for 1hand/shield and one for 2hander
The program checks for and applies lightning shield, rockbiter/or/windfury weapon, casts stormstrike on cooldown, casts flame shock and checks for flame shock debuff, if active casts earth shock. When below 30% mana, shocks are downranked to rank 3.

REQUIRED ADDONS:

Super Macros, Quick Weapon Swap
