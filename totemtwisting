-- To set this up, you make two different macros in your macro book which call upon each other. Just simplifies things into one button without modifiers. I made one called GOA and one called WF. Drag either one onto bar and it will cast desired totem and swap to the other.


-- "GOA"
/cast Grace of Air Totem
/script SetActionMacro( lastActionUsed, 'WF' )


-- "WF"
/cast Windfury Totem
/script SetActionMacro( lastActionUsed, 'GOA' )
